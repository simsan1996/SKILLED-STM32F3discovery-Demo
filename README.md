# SKILLED-STM32F3discovery-Demo
Simple game developed as a project for the course of the Embedded systems
# OVERVIEW
SKILLED is a simple game developed by using a STM32F3discovery board and RTOS ChibiOS.
The program receives data from the Compass, user Button and shell, gives output by using the eight LEDs of the board and the shell. 
# Hardware
The Hardware used is the STM32F3discovery, which is enough for a simple and funny game. 
This board provides accelerometer, gyroscope, and e-compass ST MEMS, USB connection, LEDs and push-buttons.
